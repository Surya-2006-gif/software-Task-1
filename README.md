# SOFTWARE RECRUITMENT TASK 1

#### *My learning experience*

    The learning experience was really good especially the map  
    formation problem and using linux commands  was fun.
    I learnt a tiny bit of concepts from many untouched concepts 
    by me like the github,linux, this markdown file Iam currently 
    typing,behaviour trees.I really liked this task because i love 
    to explore things that are in my intrested domain.I took me lot
    of time to learn the basics of different entities you placed 
    in the questions.Hoping to gain more knowledge from Team Shunya

#### *Challenges Faced*

    The main challenge faced by me is not getting the exact idea 
    of what question asked ,especially the map and the behaviour
    tree problem.These two question took more  time for me to
    understand and execute the requirments asked.Other challenges
    were from learning new things such as linux and github,it took
    time for me to understand them and learn the syntax.The last 
    is keeping this task's submission deadline near the 
    techno-cultural fest.
    

#### *My Approach and Resources used*
    My approach was to learn the requirements completely and then 
    start solving the problems with whatever understanding I had.
    On the way solving i faced some conflicts between the 
    requirments and my approach then I corrected my approach.
    While solving I double checked my reasoning with the conflict
    using deepseek.Also I got help from deepseek regarding the
    numpy function necessary for that task.I used some  youtube 
    videos for github and linux syntax and basic commands.
